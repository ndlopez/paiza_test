Input desired size of 2D array (H,W):

4 4

Then, input elements of the array

e.g.: rows go up to len(W) and columns go up to len(H)

# . # .
. . . .
. . # .
. . . .

The code will search for the "#" inputs and save their position (i,j)

With that info, replace "#" and corresponding "."s by another char, say "x". Finally, count how many "x"s are in the 2D array.

Output:
x x x x 
x . x . 
x x x x 
x . x . 
count 12
